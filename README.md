# 📊 Vendor Performance & Inventory Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **vendor and brand performance** using sales, purchase, and inventory data.
The goal is to understand **which vendors perform well**, **where profit is coming from**, and **where inventory and capital are getting stuck**, and then present these insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains vendor and product-level information, including:

- Total sales and purchase values
- Gross profit and profit margin
- Purchase quantities and sales quantities
- Inventory turnover and unsold capital
- Vendor and brand details

The data was analyzed after cleaning and filtering to ensure meaningful insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**

  - Pandas – data cleaning and analysis
  - Matplotlib – exploratory data visualization
  - Logging – tracking data processing steps

- **SQL** – querying and extracting required data
- **Power BI** – dashboard creation and visualization
- **Excel** – initial data review

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- Key KPIs: **Total Sales, Total Purchase, Gross Profit, Profit Margin, Unsold Capital**
- Top vendors and brands by sales
- Purchase contribution by vendor
- Identification of **low-performing vendors and brands**
- Visual comparison of sales, profit, and inventory patterns

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- A small group of vendors contributes a large portion of total purchases, indicating vendor dependency.
- Some vendors maintain high profit margins but have low sales volume, suggesting pricing or reach issues.
- Significant capital is locked in slow-moving or unsold inventory, affecting cash flow.
- Bulk purchasing reduces unit cost but does not always guarantee higher profitability.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience with **end-to-end data analysis** using Python, SQL, and Power BI
- Improved understanding of **vendor performance, profitability, and inventory management**
- Learned how to turn raw business data into **clear, decision-supporting dashboards**
- Strengthened skills in data cleaning, visualization, and analytical thinking
